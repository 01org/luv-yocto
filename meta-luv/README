I. Adding the meta-luv layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-luv layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-luv layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-luv \
    "

Then it is necessary to specify the luv distribution in local.conf.
e.g.:

  DISTRO = "luv"


Usage of Netconsole within LUV
===============================

In order to make use of the netconsole feature that is added in LUV
user must aware of its usage. Assuming users know how to get ip address and
port number (typically from 6000 ports are not assigned to specific tasks so 
they can be used) , instructions are given below to follow

Choose the ip address and port number where you  want all messages to sent to. 
once decided , you can replace the dummy ip address and port number given
in grub.cfg as netconsole=@,64001@10.11.12.13/ with the port number and ipaddress
respectively.

The grub.cfg file is located in boot partition. The location is
EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg. Edit the file to replace the numbers and notation should be 
preserved for identifying the difference between ipaddress and port number.
