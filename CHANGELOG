    poky-extract-sdk: allow relative paths for extract-dir
    
    psuedo needs a full path to its pid file, so convert
    relative extract-dir paths to full ones.
    
    The symptom of this bug is receiving the following error:
    
    pseudo: Couldn't open relative/path/to/var/pseudo/pseudo.pid: No such file or directory
    
    This fixes [BUGID #670]

    scripts/poky-qemu: Improve tmp layout assumption
    
    If someone has changed TMPDIR in local.conf to a non-standard location, the
    poky-qemu script currently doesn't handle this and assumes if BUILDDIR is set,
    $BUILDDIR/tmp will exist.
    
    Its simple to check if this exists and if not, to ask bitbake where the
    directory is so this patch changes the code to do that.

    * No longer assume SDK toolchains are installed in /opt/poky
    * [BUGFIX #568] where specifying paths to both the kernel and fs
      image caused an error due to POKY_NATIVE_SYSROOT never being
      set, triggering failure of poky-qemu-ifup/ifdown
